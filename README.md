- 👋 Hi, I’m @quieroSer
- 👀 I’m interested in learning!!! First, I was amazed by blockchain technology, and the philosophy behind bitcoin. Then, I was also amazed by ethereum, and the endless possibilities it opens. Then I joined the IvanOnTech academy. Then I figured I was going nowhere without learning javascript. Then I figured I was going nowhere without learning about Linux. So here I am: I am currently enrolled at Codecademy and Cloud Guru as well.
-PS: the one in the picture is my first son :) Alonso
